# Custom mechanical design


This is a custom design for mechanical parts matching the OS3M PCB. It has some nice features:
* Ergonomic and made to have a 2 mm soft insert.
* Compartment for adding dead weight
* Designed to have one to four 6x6x5 mm SPST switches that can be connected to the PCB (firmware not yet ready)
* The bottom has recesses for gluing in rubber "feet"

Credits: To save some time I borrowed a couple of profiles from Thingiverse #4772023 (handrest for 3dConnexion) by SenJos

The folowing parts are re-used from the original design / other forks:
* Knob - Note: If you want to use the "cap" part (it's only for aesthetics), you probably must use the knob from the fork https://github.com/Overlord6644/os3m-hardware, also included here in a slightly modified version. Regarding the 'target' (copper pieces), see below.
* Stem 
* Flexure (I have copied the reinforced version by lpurdy into the 3MF folder)

New parts:
* Base and handrest (Note: It's exported in both a on-button and a four-button version)
* Switch_cutout - needed only if you use the four-button version of the base. May need a countersunk M3 screw to stay in place.
* cap
* bottom lid - Only needed if you want to fill the bottom compartment with something heavy, like metal. Attached with four more M3 screws.
* foam_stencil - A flattened version of the foam (with holes added just to save material). It has also been schrinked 0.5mm all around. Print it and use as a cutting stencil on 2 mm foam, cork or other soft material. Not part of the final assembly!

custom_target.pdf : Print on paper and use as stencil to cut copper sheet metal (1 mm thickness is fine). It's the target designed by https://github.com/lpurdy01/os3m_target_testing/.
